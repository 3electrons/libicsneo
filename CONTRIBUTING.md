While strict code style rules are not currently enforced, please take care to follow the conventions throughout the code as closely as possible to keep the code clean. Tabs are used rather than spaces. Classes and static functions follow UpperCamelCase while member functions and variables follow standard camelCase. Structures and types which are intended to be used in the C API should be in snake_case and end with `_t`.
